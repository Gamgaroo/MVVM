In Unity Package Manager click "Add package from git URL..." and paste

> git://github.com/Gamgaroo/MVVM

to add latest version or

> git://github.com/Gamgaroo/MVVM#0.1.0

for 0.1.0 version or any other specific version ([Releases](https://github.com/Gamgaroo/MVVM/releases))

Any feedback would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.
